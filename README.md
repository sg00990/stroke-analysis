# Stroke Analysis

This is a simple analysis of the [Stroke Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset) by fedesoriano on Kaggle. I am new to analysis, so this is part of my journey to improving my skills!

## Background 
My family was shocked when my grandfather, Jim, had a stroke in June 2023. Since then, I have been finding ways to spread awareness. Jim started experiencing double vision in April 2023. The doctors weren't too concerned, but at the end of May he started experiencing severe headaches and appreaded to space out a bit. All it took was three days of this to cause a TON of damage. These symptoms didn't seem crazy, but it all climaxed on a Wednesday. Jim was bleeding on both sides of the brain and didn't fully wake up from surgery for over a week. He's slowly recovering now, but I wish to spare both individuals and their loved ones from experiencing an ordeal like this.

## Where to go
The analysis can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/sarahgraddy/stroke-analysis), [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/views/StrokeAnalysis_16866691283780/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link) or in this [repository](stroke-analysis.ipynb).
